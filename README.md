# Smart-Glasses-for-Blinds
**ABSTRACT**

  Blind mobility is one of the major challenges encountered by
visually impaired persons in their daily lives. Their life and activities
are greatly restricted by loss of eyesight. They normally travel using
blind navigation system or by their accumulated memories in their
long term exploration. The main objective of the present work is to
develop a low cost, reliable, portable, user friendly, low power and
robust solution for smooth navigation. This paper (Smart Glasses for
Blind People), as meant are the glasses are for visually impaired
people.

**WORKING**

   In this protocol when find object but distance greater than 2 meters then it
not sense, if distance less than 200 cm then it senses and create sound and
vibration. When the distance between object and user are closer, then sound
and vibration effect is high gradually.

  **Working of buzzer**

   If the object is detected within 0cm to 50cm in any one of the sensors or in
both the sensor the buzzer will beeps in a long solid beep.

   As well as if the object is detected within 51cm to 100 cm the buzzer will
beeps in an intermittent beep.

   Otherwise, if the object is detected within 101cm to 200 cm the buzzer will
beeps in a low intermittent beep.

  **Working of Vibrator**

   If the object is detected in the sensor it will check whether itâ€™s in left or right
or in both the sensors,

   If it is detected in the left sensor the left side mounted coin vibration motor
starts vibrate,

   If it is detected in the right sensor the right-side mounted coin vibration
motor starts vibrate,

   If the object is detected in both the sensors in this condition both side coin
vibration motors start vibrate.
